# XPRenamer
X-Plane Aircraft Renamer

**XPRenamer - Version 1.0**

Lightweight Python script to allow basic text information edits of X-Plane 11™ aircraft .acf files.  
Licensed under the non-restrictive MIT license.

Created by NachtRaveVL, February 17th, 2019.

This lightweight Python script allows users of X-Plane 11™ to make quick modifications of installed aircraft's basic text information, such as name, tail-number, ICAO code, etc. This utility mirrors what one would find in the Author menu of the Plane Maker application, but unlike Plane Maker this script instead does not edit anything else in the plane's .acf file except for the specific values it needs to. This makes it so that no value recomputation and/or upgrading edits are made to any of the original aircraft's .acf data, of which Plane Maker does upon saving.

## Usage

Simply save the XPRenamer.py file to a location on your computer, and run the file. Python 3 is required in order to run the file.

Feel free to suggest various edits, including additional default manufacturer names, additional fields that would be nice to have displayed, as well as pull requests.

### X-Plane 10™ Support

I am unsure if this script will work on X-Plane 10™, and as such cannot offer any direct support for it. No modification outside of the values presented in the editor are made, however. If the inclusion of any of the extra fields found in XP11 (e.g. classification options, etc.) breaks the .acf in XP10 then please drop me a line to let me know.
